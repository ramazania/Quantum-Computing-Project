# Quantum-Computing-Project
I took the CS 358: Quantum Computing course during my winter term of sophomore year with Professor Josh Davis. 
In this course, we learned about some of the quantum algorithms such as Deutsch , Simon, Shor, and Grover's algorithms which we programmed in Python using the numpy library.
